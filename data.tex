\subsection{Data}

We collected an audio signal by recording the song
`Flight of the Bumblebee' at the full frequency spectrum that a compact disc (CD) is recorded, which is 44.1 kHz. The human ear does not even hear this full spectrum.  This means that there are potential bandwidth `savings'
for transmission! This collected audio recording is referred to
as the `raw signal.'
