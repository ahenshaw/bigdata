    This project demonstrates the application of the Fast Fourier
    Transform (FFT) as a method for low-pass filtering of audio
    signals. We discuss the need for low-pass filtering to
    prevent undersampling and to reduce bandwidth requirements.
    We explain filter-design techniques and introduce GNU Radio
    as a platform for audio and radio-frequency exploration.  We
    explain and demonstrate how an appropriately-chosen low-pass filter
    can reduce bandwidth without noticeably degrading audio signal quality.

\section{Introduction} 

When an appropriate filter is designed and used to remove
unwanted frequency components, the bandwidth and power
necessary for audio signal transmission may be reduced. In
radio operations, the frequency bands are scarce resources and
are governed by national and international agencies. Every
transmitter that can interfere with others has to operate in a
licensed band and is subject to bandwidth limitations, which is
why multiple radio stations can operate in the same geographical
area. If a radio station transmits beyond its assigned bandwidth,
it will impact the signal transmission of other local radio
stations. To keep transmitters from interfering with other
transmitters in different geographic areas, power limits are
imposed. By reducing the bandwidth of their signals, a
broadcaster can maximize the impact of its power allocation.
Radio broadcasters control and limit the bandwidth of their
emissions by the use of appropriately designed  
filters\cite{notes:class}.

Both bandwidth and power savings are the motivation behind Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT)-based low-pass filters. This paper will
demonstrate that a Finite Impulse Response (FIR), low-pass filter
implemented with an FFT can remove unwanted frequency components in
order to reduce the bandwidth and power required for  
transmission.  We will also demonstrate that this bandwidth reduction
can be applied to audio signals without noticeably degrading the 
perceived quality of the sound.

\subsection{Objective}

Our objective is to design and demonstrate an FFT-based FIR
low-pass filter to reduce bandwidth of a recorded audio signal
for the purposes of AM Radio transmission.

\section{Methods}

We collected data, designed a low pass filter, pushed the signal
through the filter, and then evaluated the resulting signal.
