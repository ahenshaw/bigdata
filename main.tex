\section{Introduction}
The transmission of audio signals through radio frequency is bandwidth-limited, which is why the FCC regulates transmissions so closely. Keeping the frequency higher saves bandwidth, and the goal is to trim the frequencies without impacting the quality of what the human ear perceives. 

\subsection{Objective}
Our objective is to design and demonstrate an FFT-based low-pass filter to reduce bandwidth of a recorded audio signal for the purposes of AM Radio transmission.

\section{Methods}
We collected data, designed a low pass filter, pushed the signal through the filter, and then evaluated the resulting signal.
